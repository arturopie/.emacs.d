My Emacs
========


![facepalm](https://github.com/mbriggs/.emacs.d/raw/master/picard-facepalm.jpg)

Install
-------

Using el-get, so everything should just magically download itself on first launch. Lots of plugins, so expect it to take some time, and probably crash once or twice

Dependancies
------------

rubygems + ruby + `gem install fuzzy_file_finder`
