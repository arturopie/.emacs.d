Install
-------

Using el-get, so everything should just magically download itself on first launch. Lots of plugins, so expect it to take some time, and probably crash once or twice

Dependancies
------------

`sudo apt-get install texi2html texinfo python`

rubygems + ruby + `gem install fuzzy_file_finder fastri rcodetools`
